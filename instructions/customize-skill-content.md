## Customize the Skill to be Yours

At this point, you should have a working copy of our Hello Buttons skill.
You may modify the code in the ```index.js```.
For example, locate the line with the response: "Welcome to the Echo Buttons Test Skill.".
Change this to a custom message, and save your code.  Then, test your skill again and you should hear a new response.

Normally, you would consider submitting your skill for certification.  But, a default "hello world" skill is too simple to provide a valuable end user experience.

Once you have created a good custom skill and are ready to publish, click to the "Distribution" then "Certification" tabs in the top navigation to advance.
